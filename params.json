{"name":"Comic Book Server","tagline":"A Web Application Comic Book Viewer and Server ","body":"Comic Book Server\r\n===============\r\n\r\nA web API/Application that serves up CBR and CBZ comics and displays them in the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n## DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis is a web API/Application wriiten in python and using flask. ( pip install flask ) \r\n\r\n####This allows you to read your digital comic collection in a web browser on any device. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn its current state it will take a folder of comics ( CBZ and CBR only right now ) and will allow a user to browse through all subdirectories and select comics.\r\n\r\nOnce selected the comic is copied to a static folder, unpacked, embedded into some html and displayed. Each comic is served up from a unique folder.\r\n\r\n###Currently you will want to clean out the unique folders generated in the static folder every once an a while. It does not have a janitor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## VERSION HISTORY:\r\n\r\n**v0.1a** \r\n* Core Functionality, and some html styling. IT FUCKING WORKS!!\r\n\r\n**v0.2a**\r\n* Added Loading screen for unpacking comics\r\n\r\n**v0.3b**\r\n* Added Some basic application logging (incomplete)\r\n* Added auto scroll to top on Comic Load and Entering a new directory\r\n* Added support for GIF and PNG\r\n* Corrected Logo and Loading to not rely on external address\r\n* Added info div and link\r\n* Added better error handling for running in production \r\n\r\n**v0.4b**\r\n* Removed dependency for hardcoded urls\r\n* Updated loading screen \r\n* Added tornado front end ( for production)\r\n* Abstracted views to templates\r\n* Improved Logging\r\n\r\n**v0.5b**\r\n* Large style improvements ( Thank you Colin )\r\n* Added ability to request a comic\r\n* Random background images\r\n* Added Home button\r\n\r\n**v0.5.1b**\r\n* Style fixes\r\n* I suck at CSS\r\n\r\n**v0.6b**\r\n* Added music to the home page ( random choice of 8 comic book TV and Movie theme songs songs ) \r\n\r\n## HELP:\r\n\r\nFeel free to send me a message! I will be glad to explain my work.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMake sure you open cbv.py and change the baseDir and comicDir\r\nso if you were \r\nSo :\r\n\r\n` baseDir = \"/var/ComicBookServer/\"`\r\n\r\n `comicDir = \"/var/ComicBookServer/Comics/\"`\r\n\r\n_NOTE make sure that your comics are in folders in comicDir (I.E  /var/ComicBookServer/Comics/DC/some_comic.cbr) If you try and put comics directly in the root it may not work._ \r\n\r\nEdit the file process.sh and update the paths to point to the full path of ComicBookServer/static/sessions/\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n`/var/ComicBookServer/static/sessions/$1`\r\n\r\n_NOTE make sure you leave the $1 on the end._ \r\n\r\n\r\nEnsure you have installed:\r\n* python: `sudo apt-get install python`\r\n* pip: `easy_install pip`\r\n* [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): `sudo pip install flask`\r\n* unzip: `sudo apt-get install unzip`\r\n* unrar: `sudo apt-get install unrar`\r\n\r\n\r\nThen `cd` into your basedir and execute : `python cbv.py` to run the flask app directly \r\nor execute `python balancer.py` to execute the [tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) server with the flask app contained inside it ( for production - this requires tornado be installed `sudo pip install tornado` ) \r\n\r\n_NOTE: You may want to execute it in a screen session or something. It is not daemonized._\r\n\r\nAssuming no error, you should be able to go to `http://<your-ip>:8086/` and start using the app.\r\n\r\n#####There is no janitor for the sessions folder. You may want to go into `ComicBookServer/static/sessions/` and remove all of the directories ( should be numbers starting at zero ) every couple of days. Or do like I did and set up a cron to run at midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me if you have questions. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
