{"name":"Comic Book Server","tagline":"A Web Application Comic Book Viewer and Server ","body":"Comic Book Server\r\n===============\r\n\r\nA web API/Application that serves up CBR and CBZ comics and displays them in the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n## DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis is a web API/Application wriiten in python and using flask. ( pip install flask ) \r\n\r\n####This allows you to read your digital comic collection in a web browser on any device. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn its current state it will take a folder of comics ( CBZ and CBR only right now ) and will allow a user to browse through all subdirectories and select comics.\r\n\r\nOnce selected the comic is copied to a static folder, unpacked, embedded into some html and displayed. Each comic is served up from a unique folder.\r\n\r\n###Currently you will want to clean out the unique folders generated in the static folder every once an a while. It does not have a janitor. \r\n\r\n\r\nCheck the Installation notes out [HERE](https://github.com/mharlos/ComicBookServer/wiki/Installation)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## VERSION HISTORY:\r\n\r\n**v0.1a** \r\n* Core Functionality, and some html styling.
